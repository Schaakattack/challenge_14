## answer 
### 
The new model performed better, so it would make sense for it to be the one used going forward. 

The returns on the new model were better than the returns of the original model. The old model had returns of about 48%, with the new one at 84%. 

The accuracy was better as well, with the old model at 48%, and the new one at 57%. This shows that the new model will be better going forward.
